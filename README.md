# Work From An Introduction To Design Patterns In C++ With QT4

This is my attempt at the work in the book, "An Introduction To Design Patterns in C++ with QT4" by Alan Ezust and Paul Ezust. This text book is a free ebook as a part of a collection of free programming ebooks in [this repo] (https://www.github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) maintained by the Free Ebook Foundation.

# Motivation

Wanting to work on a personal project, I decided to want use C++ and QT as the backbone of the project as I felt it was best suited for the job. Prior to this, I had minimal experience in C++, (I helped a friend with her C++ homework and that's about it), but having strong experience in object oriented programming with both C# and Java along experience in C, I felt it would be too verbose to learn C++ from a text book then learn QT from a separate text book. So I settled on a textbook that combines the two. It won't be in depth as have an individual textbook for each topic, but I'm confident I can pick up the pieces.

# Repo Layout
The repository will be broken up by chapters. Then in each chapter, there will be folders for examples, exercises, and reviews. Each example, exercise, or review will contain a readme that will explain what is going on in the code and the requirements.

The layout will look as follows:  
/  
  -Chapter1  
    --Examples  
    --Exercises  
      ---1.4  
        ----*Program*  
        ----README.md  
    --Review  
  -Chapter2  
  -Chapter3  
  -...
